# 0011. Review and spec verification run as nested subagent orchestrators (code graph removed)

- Status: accepted (amended by 0013, 0014; mechanism superseded by 0015)
- Date: 2026-07-05

> **Amended by [ADR-0013](0013-deterministic-enforcement-gates.md)** (2026-07-09):

> **Amended by [ADR-0014](0014-measurement-first-model-continuity.md)** (2026-07-10):

## Context

ADR-0009 made pre-commit review a dynamic workflow (5–7 parallel finder lanes +
per-candidate adversarial verifiers), and ADR-0010 built verify-spec the same
way (4 parallel hunt lanes). A companion feature injected a statically-generated
dependency graph (`.claude/code-graph.json`, `bun run graph`) into every lane's
prompt to eliminate redundant codebase exploration.

Benchmarking the whole stack (2026-07-04) contradicted the design assumptions:

| Workflow | code graph | Tokens | Agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| verify-spec | off | 710K | 22 |
| verify-spec | on | 784K | 25 |
| review-diff | off | 1.11M | 28 |
| review-diff | on | 1.19M | 30 |

- Code graph injection produced **no** token savings at this project's scale
  (51 files) — "graph on" was consistently equal or worse, adding a scout agent
  and prompt bloat that outweighed any saved exploration.
- Parallel finders independently rediscovered the same bugs; dedup collapsed
  many into one, so the extra lanes bought redundancy, not coverage.
- A single comprehensive finder reading the diff once yields equivalent findings
  at roughly 1/5 the cost.

## Decision

Both reviews run as **pinned named subagents that preload a procedure skill**,
not dynamic workflows, and the code graph is removed entirely.

Each verification is a `.claude/agents/*.md` definition (model set per agent —
see each `.claude/agents/*.md`) whose behavior
is fixed by its system prompt and whose procedure is the single source of truth
in a preloaded skill (`skills:` frontmatter injects the full skill at startup, so
it cannot be silently ignored). The agent runs the finding pass itself and
dispatches a **separate verifier child** (`general-purpose`, depth 2) so the
finder is never its own verifier:

- **`code-reviewer`** (preloads `review-diff`): find all bug lenses + AGENTS.md and
  path-scoped rules (coverage-first) → dedup by (file, line) → verifier child
  REFUTEs each (`high` uses three lenses with majority kill) → return ranked
  findings. Its completion stamps `.claude/.review-stamp` via the existing
  `post-agent-review-stamp.sh` hook (matched on `subagent_type == code-reviewer`) —
  no manual stamp step. This merges the former "workflow" and "fallback dispatch"
  paths into one: dispatching `code-reviewer` *is* the review.
- **`spec-verifier`** (preloads `verify-spec`): formalize the spec → hunt all four
  lenses → verifier child replays each trace. Design-time; no stamp.

The find → adversarial-verify discipline, the commit-gate contract, and the
fail-closed guarantees from ADR-0009/0010 are unchanged — only the mechanism is.
Supersedes ADR-0009 and ADR-0010.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep the workflows, drop only the code graph**: rejected — the parallel
  lanes were the larger waste; graph removal alone leaves ~1.1M-token runs.
- **Keep code graph for future scale**: rejected — it can be reintroduced from
  git history if the codebase grows enough to make exploration dominate; carrying
  a proven-net-negative feature speculatively violates "don't over-engineer".
- **Fold both into the parent session (no dedicated agent)**: rejected — the
  fresh, implementation-blind context is the bias check; a pinned agent preserves
  it while keeping child token cost out of the parent's context.
- **A `general-purpose` agent carrying the procedure inline in the dispatch
  prompt**: rejected — an inline prompt can be varied or ignored per dispatch. A
  named agent (`.claude/agents/*.md`) with a preloaded skill pins behavior in the
  system prompt, reuses the existing `code-reviewer` stamp hook, and versions the
  procedure in one file.

## Consequences

- Review cost drops to the agent itself (finder) + one verifier child = 2 agents
  per run, for both review-diff and verify-spec.
- `code-reviewer` gains the `Agent` tool (to dispatch its verifier child) and the
  `review-diff` skill preload; `spec-verifier` is a new agent with the
  `verify-spec` skill preload. The verifier children are `general-purpose`,
  pinned by the preloaded skill's dispatch prompt.
- Deleted: `scripts/build-graph.ts` (+ test), `.claude/code-graph.json`, the
  `graph` npm script, `.gitattributes` graph rule, `.claude/workflows/`, and the
  companion code-graph design spec + plan under `docs/superpowers/`.
  `pre-commit-guard.sh` keeps only the gate check (no graph regeneration).
- The `PreToolUse(Workflow)` stamp-clear (`pre-workflow-clear-review-stamp.sh`)
  is replaced by `pre-agent-review-clear.sh` on `PreToolUse(Agent)` scoped to
  `subagent_type == code-reviewer` (skipping sidechains). This keeps the gate
  symmetric — dispatching `code-reviewer` clears the stamp, its completion
  recreates it — so ADR-0009's "cleared at the next review launch" guarantee is
  preserved despite the mechanism change: a stale stamp from a prior cycle cannot
  survive a review that errors, times out, or is interrupted before
  `post-agent-review-stamp.sh` fires. (The `aegis_compile_context` clear remains
  as the new-cycle reset.)
- The skill dispatch prompts are load-bearing for every commit; changes go
  through empirical tuning (ADR-0006 consequence carries over).
- LLM-driven dedup is non-deterministic, an accepted tradeoff: the old JS dedup
  was also lossy (keyed on file:line, merging distinct same-line defects).
