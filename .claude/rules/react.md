# React Purity (not caught by linters)

Render must be a pure computation. The following three principles are independent — a violation of any one breaks purity.

- **Idempotent** — Components and hooks must return the same result for the same inputs, regardless of how many times or when they are called. Never produce values during render that depend on call count or timing. e.g. `new Date()`, `Math.random()`, `crypto.randomUUID()`, direct `fetch()`, incrementing an ID counter.
- **No side effects in render** — Render only computes JSX — it must not observe or change the outside world. Side effects belong in `useEffect` or event handlers. e.g. `document.title = ...`, `window.scrollTo()`, observational `console.log()`, writes to a global store. The memoization-cache exception under "No mutation of non-local values" applies here equally: a semantically transparent cache write is not an observable effect.
- **No mutation of non-local values** — Only values created within the current render call may be mutated. Module-scope and shared objects are off-limits. e.g. `push` into a module-scope array, incrementing a counter declared outside the function, mutating properties of an argument object. The single exception is a semantically transparent memoization cache: module-scope, keyed purely by the function's inputs, written idempotently (same key always yields the same value), and observable by nothing but the memoized function itself — mutating one during render changes no rendered output, so idempotence is preserved (see Synchronizing with External Systems).

# React Calls Components and Hooks (not caught by linters)

- **Never pass hooks as values** — Don't pass hooks as props, arguments, or return values. A hook must be called directly and statically inside the component or hook that uses it. e.g. `<Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />`, returning a hook from a factory function, storing a hook in a variable and calling it conditionally.
- **Never create higher-order hooks** — Don't wrap or compose hooks dynamically at call time. Instead, inline the logic into a new named hook. e.g. `const useDataWithLogging = withLogging(useData)` — write a `useDataWithLogging` hook that calls `useData` and logging directly.

# You Might Not Need an Effect (not caught by linters)

The deciding question: is this code running because the user did something (event), or because the component appeared on screen (sync with external system)? Only the latter justifies `useEffect`.

- **Derived values** — Never `useEffect` + `setState` to transform props/state into another state. Compute inline or `useMemo` for expensive calculations.
- **State reset on prop change** — Don't `useEffect(() => setX(initial), [prop])`. Give the component a `key={prop}` so React remounts it with fresh state.
- **Partial state adjustment on prop change** — Prefer deriving the value from existing state/props instead of syncing with an effect. e.g. store `selectedId` instead of `selectedItem`, and derive the item via `items.find()`.
- **Effect chains** — Multiple effects where each sets state that triggers the next is a sign that the logic belongs in a single event handler that batches all state updates at once.
- **Notifying parent of state change** — Don't `useEffect(() => onChange(value), [value])`. Call `onChange` directly in the same event handler that calls `setValue`.
- **useEffect is not componentDidMount** — Don't think of `useEffect(() => {}, [])` as "run once on mount." An effect synchronizes with external systems whenever its reactive dependencies change; mount and update are a single unified lifecycle. When you want "skip on initial render," reframe: the real need is usually an early return based on state value (e.g. `if (!roomId) return;`), not a ref-based "first render" flag.

# Synchronizing with External Systems (not caught by linters)

Corollaries of "You Might Not Need an Effect" for things that genuinely live
outside React (fonts, observers, canvas, storage). Learned refactoring the
KernLab canvas engine from 4 effects + 3 states down to 1 effect + 0 states
(react-doctor 61→100); reference implementation:
`src/components/features/kern-lab/useKernLab.ts` + `engine/fontLoader.ts`.

- **useSyncExternalStore for external readiness** — When "is X ready?" comes from
  an external system (font loading, media queries, storage), don't mirror it
  with `useState` + effect. Keep a module-level store (subscribe / snapshot)
  and read it with `useSyncExternalStore`. Its server snapshot (`() => false`)
  doubles as the SSR/hydration guard, replacing the `mounted`-flag pattern.
- **Module scope for app initialization** — Once-per-page-load work (injecting a
  stylesheet link, kicking off the default resource load) runs at module level
  behind a `typeof document === "undefined"` guard, not in a `[]` effect. Once
  per app is not once per mount.
- **Event handlers trigger resource loads** — When a user choice requires loading
  an external resource, start the load in the change handler that made the
  choice. If the handler needs the post-patch state, predict it by calling the
  pure reducer (`reducer(state, patch)`) — never add an effect that watches the
  state to react to it.
- **Reducers own state invariants** — When one field constrains another
  (selected weight must be valid for the family), enforce it inside the reducer
  on every patch. No adjust-state-in-effect, no re-clamping at every read site.
- **Expensive derivation is still derivation** — A computation that uses the
  DOM as a calculator (offscreen-canvas text measurement) belongs in `useMemo`
  during render when it is idempotent and memoized (module-level cache keyed by
  its inputs), not in an effect copying results into state. Gate it on the
  external readiness snapshot so it never runs during SSR.
- **Callback refs with cleanup for element observers (React 19)** — Attach
  ResizeObserver / IntersectionObserver to an element in a callback ref that
  returns a cleanup, not in a mount effect. Read measurements procedurally at
  use time (`el.clientWidth` at draw time) instead of mirroring them into
  state when the consumer is imperative anyway.
- **Latest-ref for callbacks that outlive renders** — A subscription that must
  run "the current logic" calls `latestRef.current()`; the sync effect updates
  the ref each render. This avoids re-subscribing per render and stale
  closures.
- **The last effect standing must read as a sentence** — After the above, every
  remaining `useEffect` should read as "synchronize [external system] with
  [rendered value]" (e.g. paint the canvas from the computed layout). An effect
  that doesn't fit that sentence has a better home.

# Component Splitting (not caught by linters)

- **Re-render boundaries** — A component boundary is also a re-render boundary. When parts of a UI update at different frequencies, split them into separate components so expensive subtrees don't re-render unnecessarily. When a library offers both a hook API and a render-props/component API, prefer the one that isolates re-renders to the smallest scope.
- **Generic component naming** — Props of generic/reusable components should follow standard HTML attribute and platform conventions to minimize mental mapping cost. e.g. `<MyImage src={url} />` not `<MyImage imageUrl={url} />`. For controlled/uncontrolled patterns, follow the Radix convention: `open`/`onOpenChange`/`defaultOpen`, not `isVisible`/`onToggle`.
- **Transparent native wrappers** — UI-library-level components wrapping a native element (`input`, `button`, `a`) should accept all native attributes via `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"input">` and spread them. Don't restrict props to a handpicked subset — that blocks a11y attributes and makes the wrapper strictly worse than the raw element.
- **Event handler props name intent, not mechanism** — Callback props represent what the component communicates, not how the user interacts. Naming after the DOM event (`onClickPlay`) couples the interface to a specific interaction, breaking when the trigger changes to keyboard, gesture, or programmatic call. e.g. `onPlayMovie` not `onClickPlayMovie`.
- **Minimal props (avoid stamp coupling)** — A child that receives more data than it needs is coupled to the parent's data shape and re-renders when unrelated fields change. Pass the narrowest data that satisfies the child's responsibility. e.g. `<ArticleTitle title={article.title} />` not `<ArticleTitle article={article} />`.
- **useReducer for stable callbacks** — A callback that closes over state breaks identity stability — `useCallback` can't help because its deps include the state. `useReducer` eliminates this by design: `dispatch` is identity-stable and state access moves into the reducer. Reach for `useReducer` when callbacks and state are intertwined, not only when state shape is complex.
- **Reactive vs procedural API** — Libraries offer both reactive APIs (re-render on change: `watch()`, `useSWR`) and procedural APIs (get current value on demand: `getValues()`, `useMutation`). Match the API to the trigger: display-driven → reactive, user-action-driven → procedural/mutation. Don't use `useSWR` for user-initiated fetches; don't use `watch()` inside event handlers.

# Module Organization (not caught by linters)

- **No pass-through layers** — Don't create components that only receive props and forward them to a child. If a component adds no logic, layout, or abstraction, it's a useless intermediate layer that deepens the dependency chain and obscures data flow. Keep the tree flat where possible.
- **Colocation over classification** — Don't organize by technical role (`hooks/`, `atoms/`, `utils/`). Place modules next to where they're used. Colocation limits scope by default — a module in a feature directory is implicitly private to that feature. Classification directories force everything to be "potentially reusable," increasing cognitive load. Only truly generic modules (no domain knowledge — could ship as a library) belong in shared directories like `_ui/` or `_utils/`. A small domain-specific component belongs with its feature, not in a shared directory because of its size. Classify by purpose (data fetching → `_repositories/`), not by implementation mechanism (hook → `_hooks/`). A single concern (e.g. "posts API") often exports a type, a query factory, an async function, and a hook — keep them together in one directory, not scattered across `/types`, `/hooks`, `/utils`.
- **Small for complexity, not reuse** — The purpose of extracting a module is to reduce complexity and limit its scope of usage, not to make it reusable. A module used in exactly one place is fine — what matters is that it has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **No ceremony for small modules** — Don't wrap every small component in its own directory with `index.ts`. Place files directly in the parent directory. The overhead of creating a directory + re-export barrel for each module discourages fine-grained splitting, which is the opposite of what we want.
- **Directories mirror exclusive ownership** — Inside a feature, create a subdirectory only when a parent exclusively owns its children (a control panel and its private field/slider/toggle components). Exclusivity is decided by imports, not JSX nesting. A component consumed by two parents has lost exclusivity: move it up to the nearest common ancestor, or to `components/shared/<name>/` when the consumers are different features. Within a feature, never a directory for a single file (the `components/shared/<name>/` convention is the exception: each shared concern gets its own directory).
- **A web of functions is one box** — "Place a function in its caller's directory" only works when the call graph is a tree. When modules form a web (a measurement/layout engine whose parts call each other and share constants/types), group the whole concern in one purpose-named directory (`engine/`) instead of nesting by caller — otherwise nobody owns the shared pieces and the tree churns on every refactor.
- **Cross-feature sharing has two homes** — Shared components go to `components/shared/<name>/`; shared non-component values with no component affinity (a repo URL) go to `src/lib/`. One feature must never import from another feature's directory. The exception to the `src/lib/` rule: a style-string constant tied to one shared component colocates next to that component in its own `.ts` file (never co-exported from the component file).
- **CSS backing a shared class loads globally** — A colocated feature stylesheet only loads when that feature's component is imported. If a class is used across features (a shared link treatment), its rules belong in the global stylesheet — otherwise a route that never mounts the owning feature silently loses them.
